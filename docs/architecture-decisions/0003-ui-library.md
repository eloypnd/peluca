# 4. UI library

Date: 2017-08-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Choose a UI library to build this UI patterns library.

As of August 2017 we do have a lot of interesting UI libraries that can use for this project. Just to name the most popular ones: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Decision

We will adhere here to the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and go for the most ~trendy~ popular library ever: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Consequences

We write every UI pattern as a React component.
